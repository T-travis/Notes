This is my first React and Redux app.  It is a front end only app (at this time) but implements CRUD principlces using Redux.  
Still needs more styles added.

In progress and completing locally.  Maybe implement on AWS in the future.  For the backend I will be using Node.js, Express,
and DynamoDB.  The API will be used for all CRUD operations between the frontend and the database.
